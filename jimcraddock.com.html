I could not play the guitar for several months, or even put my arm around my wife at night.  My shoulder joint became loose and would pop out of position with pain.  My arm muscles would tear when I stretched my arm.  I would often need to ice my muscles and arm in order to deal with the pain. This was not a joint issue, it was much larger.  Over the following months it progressed to my chest, with the burning feeling occurring there.  Then it moved to my other shoulder and arm.  I could not raise my elbow above my shoulder.  During this time I first sought out my neurologist and then orthopedic doctor. An EMG was run, normal.  A NMR was done showing some inflammation.  An MRI was done showing nothing too significant in the joint.  I tried to emphasize it was muscular.  I saw a rheumatologist, she insisted it was orthopedic, and would not listen to my complex history.  So, I returned to the orthopedist only to be told it was definitely not orthopedic.  Meanwhile, my PCP put my on Lyrica and this immediately helped with the surface pain, but not the tearing or joint pain.  I could not put any weight on my elbow while lying down or hold myself up with my arms off the bed.  I returned to the rheumatologist who once again insisted the problem was orthopedic.  My neurologist got me an appointment with a University of Kansas rheumatologist, she said it was nothing she could identify and recommended injections prior to attempting physical therapy because the pain felt was too much to start physical therapy right away.</td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="50"></td><td class="line-content">  This process of referrals took 7 months. Meanwhile, the stiffness in my right arm went away.  Over the last month much of the pain has subsided.  Around the first week of February, I suddenly had a return of pain in the muscles of both shoulders accompanied with burning and aching and sensitivity on pressure.  This lasted about 48hours.  It subsided with a movement of the symptoms to my gut.  First, I had a sudden release sound in my abdomen, like a gurgling rush.  Several hours later I had sudden diarhea. Then I felt great for a few days and experienced some constipation. A week or so later, I experienced fairly intense abdominal aching for about 48 hours.  Then once again I felt better than ever, with only minor pains/sensitivity on pressure in the muscles of my shoulder.  This was followed on Sunday, 2/24/2024 by sudden cramping and diarhea.  Over these 3 weeks, I've lost 15-16 pounds. I have remained eating. Not skipping any meals. I had a CMP done on Monday, it showed high BUN, high BUN/creatinine, and low alkaline phosphatase.</td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="51"></td><td class="line-content">  While these last two years have been very hard, my total history paints a fuller picture. I can explain everything, sadly, the science behind it has been redacted and is not available anywhere that I can find.

However, my stomach wouldn't stop burning.  It was my entire abdomen that would burn, I drank more and more water over a period of weeks.  I tried licorice tablets, as they were supposed to help the stomach.  Soon, I wasn't eating.  Then, I could no longer urinate (I had a previous episode with SIADH about 6 years earlier which I had forgotten - explained in longer writeup).  I started taking potassium pills, then I took my grandmother's Lasix, my heart was beating so hard I then thought I was having a heart attack and took a nitroglycerin.</td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="56"></td><td class="line-content">  <span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="57"></td><td class="line-content">  <span class="html-tag">&lt;p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="58"></td><td class="line-content">  I still couldn't urinate, despite having drank an immense amount of water.

I tried bearing down while attempting to urinate, I then experienced extreme pain and bulging of veins in my right leg and testicle, this was followed moments later with the same effect on my left side.

The condition was listed as "very rare." I read all about it.  It described my exact situation of uncontrolled polyuria following an infection and Intra abdominal candidiasis brought on in the original treated patients by damage from tuberculosis to the adrenals.  It was called Terminal Onset Diabetes Insipidus with Candidiasis Majeure.  It said the condition would rapidly lead to a stroke from dehydration.   One sentence clearly stands out in my mind ' the article said the condition was all about ATP.  I had no idea what ATP was at the time, but that sentence is the truth.  This condition is all about ATP generation and maximizing the ATP the candidiasis can consume. The condition is caused by a change in how the heart beats brought on by a severe electrolyte imbalance where potassium reaches very high levels.  The details are technical and quite unbelievable for today's medicine, but here is a short summary.</td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="74"></td><td class="line-content">  <span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="75"></td><td class="line-content">  <span class="html-tag">&lt;p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="76"></td><td class="line-content">  The change is caused by the bearing down to urinate while in this hyponatraemic state, somehow the AV node takes over the duties of the SA node.  This causes a change in the way the heart beats, essentially switching to suction during expansion causing a slight narrowing of the inferior vena cava such that a backpressure exists below the kidneys and above the iliac veins, this in turn causes a change in polarization at the nephrons (I don't understand the exact how of that, it is hard to remember all the details after 28 years).  This then basically reverses the functions of the kidneys.  This fixes the inability to urinate from SIADH, but causes potassium to be retained and sodium to be lost instead of the other way around when attempting to preserve volume.</td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="77"></td><td class="line-content">  <span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="78"></td><td class="line-content">  <span class="html-tag">&lt;p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="79"></td><td class="line-content">  There were two remedies in the article.  One was from the original experiments on the subjects with this condition and one was for modern medicine.  The modern medicine fix was an ethanol IV and the stopping and restarting of the heart.

This solution was based on the early 19th Century experiments which were the main topic of the case study.  This solution involved having the subject hold their urination to "sufficiently acidify" the body and injecting the subject with adrenalin. This induced  a surge in blood pressure that caused a pseudo stroke at the pituitary causing it to take control of the electrolyte balance from the hypothalamus through directing regulating hormones.</td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="83"></td><td class="line-content">  <span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="84"></td><td class="line-content">  <span class="html-tag">&lt;p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="85"></td><td class="line-content">  My legs were feeling leaden, I was freezing cold, bruising easily, and feeling horrible.

I then sat down and drank one entire two liter bottle and started on the next one and refused every urge to urinate.

Basically, when the pituitary takes over, it forces the candidiasis into cells and the potassium into the epidermal layer.  In order to do this, it shuts down or repurposes part of the immune system that would normally attack the candidiasis.   I won't get all the science right, but obviously at some point (years later) a limit in storing this pootassium is reached. At that limit, the heart beats harder and harder trying to push potassium out, but there is no more room.  The article had graphs of electrolyes concentrations and how changed.  When the limit is reached, the heart is damaged.   Trust me I felt that moment.  Increasing chest pressure over hours until suddenly while urinating a complete release of pressure and a sudden feeling of fluid in my feet, I literally though my socks were wet.</td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="95"></td><td class="line-content">  <span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="96"></td><td class="line-content">  <span class="html-tag">&lt;p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="97"></td><td class="line-content">  At this point, circulatory fluid is released due to the heart damage, but ankles don't swell, because the tissues are full of potassium and apopotic from the candidiasis inside the cells running the Na/K pump in reverse.  But this now works to decrease/rinse the potassium out.  Instead, sodium bicarbonate begins to accumulate.  This leads to another transition, as the pH of the body crosses the area at which the candiasis becomes active.  This leads to skin burning, intestinal issues, and more.  Eventually, this reaches a limit and causes yet another transition.  These last transitions have to do with the pituitary changing how hard it works. Basically, the pituitary tries to keep blood sugars below 100 at all times, but eventually, it cannot do this without effectively going into failure, so it suddenly stops working so hard.

The polyuria persisted for weeks until I had lost 25 pounds.  This was all the fluid being held in the flesh below my waist by the backpressure.  With the backpressure gone, the fluids and salts could no longer be held back.  Notably, my waist, legs and butt were where all the weight was lost.

This was a thick medical book that was indexed in the back by every possible keyword. For example, you could look up polyuria and it would list every page that word appeared on.  This was a great help in finding the article in question, basically it was the one place where polyuria and candidiasis both appeared.  Second, the condition itself was labeled as Rare or Very Rare and was a much longer description than most.  It was pages long and had numerous black and white photos.  I can vividly recall the photos.  Third, the article described the condition, and all the phases at length based on knowledge from a large number of subjects.  Enough subjects that many (more than 20) of them were in the final phase at the same time.  As the condition is decades long, that tells me the number of people treated this way was large.  It was in a large city.  It had small graphs that indicated how potassium concentration changed over time, another graph that showed how the oxygenation curve was pushed due to changes in pH and pressure.  It had pictures of the experimental subjects both alive and after the disease had run its course. One picture was of a group of men eating a grand meal. Another was an almost impossible to make out night photo listed as the only photo of someone experiencing the transition to pure ketosis which happens once at night and is noted by the mechanical movement of the subject for a very brief time (hours). There were photos of people immobilzed in metal horse troughs surrounded by empty ice cream containers.  The ice cream was because it was the only thing that would increase their osmolality enough to continue causing the pituitary (which is essentially turned up via increased osmolality) to continue forcing salts and sugars into their body which was the only way they were generating ATP. There was a photo of a guy doing pullups being cheered on with the caption noting exercise was not advisable during the final period and that this person died 23 days later. There were other photos that were frankly morbid which I will not go into here.</td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="135"></td><td class="line-content">     <span class="html-tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="136"></td><td class="line-content">     <span class="html-tag">&lt;p&gt;</span></td></tr><tr><td class="line-number" value="137"></td><td class="line-content">     Needless to say, there was a lot of organic and biochemistry in the article.

It discussed everything from the Kreb's cycle to the Na/K pump, individual hormones, and more.  There was even more than one path the subjects could take once they went through the final transition.  Notably, one group was referred to as "toads."  These subjects would subsist on alcohol after their bowels stopped, but to do so, their body had to be immersed in a brine solution.  There were two other paths that had to do with a decision around eating and drinking.  It is truly a loss to science to not have this knowledge available.

It talked about how the subjects body was essentially "locked in" at the initial point.  This is because the body could no longer gain or lose fat because ATP generation was through alternative means.  That while the subjects would lose and gain weight during the disease it was always just salts and water and at each transition they would return to the starting weight before the next phase began.

I even remember back in the early 2000's knowing I had entered a transition and returning several brand new sets of pants (33") that I knew would soon be loose and baggy due to the weight loss that was just starting.  In the article it talked about how the subjects would often wear two pairs of pants because they were typically cold during these transitions and the pants would easily fit on top of each other. It talked about changes in body shape and face shape, which I have certainly seen.  It discussed how muscle fibers, being just one cell (which blew my mind at the time), would still work after being apoptotic, as they shrunk and became full of just electrolytes they would conduct nerve signals more efficiently and the system would compensate by sending stronger signals leading to hyperreflexivity.  And how the muscles could enlarge even in the apoptotic state by forcing salts and fluid into the muscle cell. I can remember in 2012 when I had a transition and I could barely walk I felt so weak.  I couldn't go up stairs for a week or two.  Slowly, my system adjusted and I eventually even returned to running and biking.  I always wondered why my times were slower after that and why I was always passed on my bike by people in much worse shape than I was in while going up hills.

Since blood tests and imaging wouldn't show anything, the article did discuss physical changes that occurred.  It talked about the body shape changes I've mentioned. Specifically, during different phases how the face would would moon shaped, or thin, or more square jawed, due to changes in hormones and body fluid. Similarly, the body would be thin or retain enough fluids to cause small breasts and an overhang of flesh around the abdomen, while the legs would undergo similar transformations swelling some with the retained fluids an salts and then shrinking during the next transition.  I bought some 31 skinny jeans during my 2018 transition. I could wear them for less than half a year before they just wouldn't fit.  They fit again with a month of my 2022 transition.

They would be strong due to all the extra minerals, but the flesh underneath would shrink.  It was actually a painful process, in my experience.  During the transitions when this shrinking was occurring, the bed of the nails hurt/ached.  It would leave a single horizontal white line across my nail during these times that eventually grew out as well as vertical ridges from the narrowing.  Additionally, the length of the bed of the nail shortened a small amount on each finger leading to squarer nails.  The article said that toenails would become "vestigial." I remember being somewhat mystified by that, but now it makes sense. My toenails are strong, but I can tear a toenail down the center and it just comes off, only the edge is connected to my skin.  It also discussed how the acidic pH of the body would cause osteopenia, which I have.  It also talked about how the calcium lost in the bones would be replaced by heavier minerals somehow.  I broke a rib in 2016 or so simply by resting my weight on my ribs at the top of an obstacle wall.

The article even mentioned how anyone with the condition today would be labeled as a hypochondriac and give up on medicine.  I've experienced this over and over in my life.  If blood tests and imaging are normal no one considers changes in the interstitial space/cellular level. I find the discussion of modern medicine and its application to be noteworthy, as it means someone in the modern world (c. 1990) had researched the condition.  Why?  How?  Modern ethics seem to make it taboo.  The article also mentioned how the disease was going to be reclassified as something else possibly into an auto-immune polyendocrine category. Finally, I have never been able to find reference to the article, the condition, or even the experiments in question.  I believe the research was essentially redacted by modern ethics due to the fundamental changes it causes in the way the human body functions, the negative outcomes, and the pre-Neuremberg/informed consent time of the experiments. The final part of the article discussed how it had been looked at during the days when super soldier programs were a real thing because there are elements to it that improve the functioning of the body and mind.
